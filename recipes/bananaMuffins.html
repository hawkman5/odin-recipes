    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's finally here folks, my family's famous banana muffins. All throughout my youth I enjoyed the pleasure of biting into these scrumptious morsels. When I went to college I finally asked my mother to share the recipe with me. Finally I was able to cook something other than scrambled eggs in my dorm room! They have been a hit at home get togethers and workplace socials, and I attribute them to my success as a well rounded individual.</p>

    <p>Below I will break down the recipe for you and teach you exactly how to make these delicious snacks. The original recipe calls for three bananas. When I travelled to the great state of Hawaii, I learned a secret from the local bakers. The key to sweet banana bread is to add more bananas! Who knew? I now prefer to add six bananas that are fully ripened with a lot of soft brown spots. This is the key to getting the sweetest texture possible.</p>
