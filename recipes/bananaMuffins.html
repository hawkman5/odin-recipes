        <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>It's finally here folks, my family's famous banana muffins. All throughout my youth I enjoyed the pleasure of biting into these scrumptious morsels. When I went to college I finally asked my mother to share the recipe with me. Finally I was able to cook something other than scrambled eggs in my dorm room! They have been a hit at home get togethers and workplace socials, and I attribute them to my success as a well rounded individual.</p>

        <p>Below I will break down the recipe for you and teach you exactly how to make these delicious snacks. The original recipe calls for three bananas. When I travelled to the great state of Hawaii, I learned a secret from the local bakers. The key to sweet banana bread is to add more bananas! Who knew? I now prefer to add six bananas that are fully ripened with a lot of soft brown spots. This is the key to getting the sweetest texture possible.</p>

        <p>This recipe makes 12 large muffins or 1 large loaf</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp. butter, melted</li>
            <li>3-6 ripe medium bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F if you are making a loaf of bread).</li>
            <li>Combine flour, soda, and salt in a medium bowl and set that aside.</li>
            <li>Mix egg, sugar, and butter in a large mixing bowl. Once mixed, add your mashed bananas and mix further. Combine this with your flour mixture. At this point, add your nuts if you so choose(I don't like mine with nuts so I skip this step).</li>
            <li>Pour your mixture into a greased muffin pan (or a greased six cup bread loaf pan).</li>
            <li>Bake muffins for 25-30 minutes. If making bread, bake for 60-75 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the muffins cool for at least 10 minutes before enjoying them!</li>
        </ol>
